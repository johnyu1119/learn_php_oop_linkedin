PHP remains one most popular server-side languages used to build dynamic websites. Although it is not especially difficult to use, nonprogrammers often find it intimidating. This introductory course was designed to change that by teaching you PHP through a series of clear, focused, and easy-to-follow lessons. After briefly explaining what PHP is, instructor Joe Casabona introduces the features of the language. Joe covers control structures, variables, arguments, and person class in a series of hands-on exercises. He then moves on to more advanced topics, including try/catch statements, resolving changes between versions of PHP, and form validation. Upon wrapping up this course, you'll have the skills you need to start developing and maintaining interactive websites using PHP.
